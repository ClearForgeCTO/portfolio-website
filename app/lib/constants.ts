  bio: `I never meant to end up in technology. I was a firefighter, a tow truck driver, and a mechanic—my hands were built for fixing things you could touch. I ran an auto repair shop for the country's biggest tire and battery chain, coming home every night smelling like motor oil and tire rubber.

Then fate walked through my shop door. A local IT manager I'd been fixing cars for had an off-the-wall question: "What do you think about coming to work with me?" I laughed. Nothing about me screamed "tech person."

But his logic was bulletproof: "We need someone who understands how businesses actually work, not just how computers work."

That decision led to an unlikely journey: from helpdesk support to IBM architect, spending two decades building technology infrastructure for Fortune 100 companies and federal agencies. I traveled the world, stood in war rooms during cyber breaches, and watched budgets that could fund small countries.

But I learned something that haunts me: the biggest players in technology actively design systems to keep smaller players out. Not maliciously—systemically. The complexity, the costs, the implementation timelines—all of it creates a moat around capabilities that could revolutionize any business.

I became the bridge between those worlds. The translator who could explain why a $50 million system worked the way it did, and how you could get 80% of the benefit for 2% of the cost—if you knew what you were doing.

After achieving 135% of my sales target at a global technology company, I got let go on a Friday morning. By 11 AM, I was unemployed for the first time since I was seventeen.

That crossroads led me to a Port Saint Lucie Business Club networking event. I walked out with rage in my stomach. Small businesses—43% of US GDP—had no idea what technology could do for them. Not because they weren't smart, but because we'd locked that knowledge away behind enterprise pricing and complexity.

That's when I knew I wasn't going back to enterprise tech. I was going to tear down the walls.`,
