# Welcome to the Blog

This is an example blog post to demonstrate how the markdown-based blog system works.

## How to Create a New Post

Creating a new blog post is simple:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `/content/blog/` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with title, date, excerpt, author, and tags
3. Write your content in markdown below the frontmatter
4. The post will automatically appear on the blog page!

## Markdown Support

You can use all standard markdown features:

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
```

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Blockquotes

> "The future belongs to those who understand what's possible and learn to leverage it."

### Emphasis

You can use **bold text** and *italic text* for emphasis.

## SEO Optimization

Each blog post automatically generates:

- Meta title tags
- Meta descriptions
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Structured data for search engines
- Clean, SEO-friendly URLs

## What's Next?

Start writing! Just create your markdown files and they'll automatically appear on your blog with full styling and SEO optimization.
